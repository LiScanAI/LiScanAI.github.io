  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open-source AI-specific licenses represent a new form of social contract in the digital age,
  introducing complexities and multidimensional challenges for license compatibility detection. Unlike traditional SPDX licenses, 
  open-source AI models adopt a hierarchical licensing framework encompassing global licenses and component licenses (</strong>Code, </strong>Weights, </strong>Data), 
  along with novel clauses such as technical constraints, commercial restrictions, and ethical responsibilities.
  These unique characteristics render conventional license compatibility detection tools ineffective. <br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the above limitations, in this paper, we developed a technique,
  <a href="https://slimming-fat.github.io/SLIMMING/"><strong>SLIMMING</strong></a>, to remove bloated dependencies from software
  projects reliably. Slimming statically analyzes the Java reflections
  that are commonly leveraged by <strong>popular frameworks</strong> (e.g., Spring
  Boot) and resolves the reflective targets via parsing <strong>configuration
  files</strong> (*.xml, *.yml and *.properties). By <strong>modeling string manipulations</strong>,
  Slimming fully resolves the string arguments of our
  concerned reflection APIs to identify all the required dependencies.
  More importantly, it helps developers analyze the debloating solutions
  by <strong>weighing the benefits against the costs of dependency
  management</strong>.<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our evaluation results show that the static reflection
  analysis capability of Slimming outperforms all the other existing
  techniques with 97.0% of Precision and 98.8% of Recall. Compared
  with the prior debloating techniques, Slimming can reliably remove
  the bloated dependencies with a 100% test passing ratio and improve
  the rationality of debloating solutions. In our large-scale study in
  the Maven ecosystem, Slimming reported 484 bloated dependencies
  to 66 open-source projects. 38 reports (57.6%) have been confirmed
  by developers.
